Xpose 4 News/Changelog

Changes in version 4.4.1

  o Updates to kaplan.plot.R (thanks to Leonid Gibiansky for reporting the problems)

  o kaplan.plot.R: Removed debugging command that was mistakenly left in function

  o kaplan.plot.R: "ylab" argument is now passed to the plot when cov option is used.

  o kaplan.plot.R: Using the cov option with repeated censoring and no observations 
    to break up the chain then the mean value calculation was wrong (only used the
    surviving IDs and the last censored ID). Fixed now. 

  o Changed the "aspect" argument for all plots to default to "fill".  
    Previously it was "1".  

Changes in version 4.4.0

  o Added bootstrap of the GAM and diagnostics for the boostrap of the
    PsN function boot_scm. 

Changes in version 4.3.6
  
  o fixed the plot in the classic menu system "Weighted residuals vs
    covariates". 

Changes in version 4.3.5

  o Updated help files with workable examples, and an example
    dataset.  Look at data(simpraz.xpdb), simprazExample() and
    example(xpose.data) for dataset examples and example(basic.gof)
    and example(cwres.vs.idv) for plot examples. Most of the
    xpose4specific functions now have examples that can be run with
    example().

  o Updated kaplan.plot() so that the kaplan-meier mean covariate
    (KMMC) plot can be created. Also added more options for adjusting
    plot properties.

  o New gofSetup() command to create your own customized series of GOF plots. 

  o fixed how RSE values were reported on runsum() when the parameter
    was fixed.

  o Fixed argument to xpose.VPC.categorical(max.plots.per.page=1), so
    that only one plot per page was possible. 

  o Fixed xpose.VPC() so that the psn option for vpc
    "confidence_interval=X" works.  

  o Fixed compute.cwres() function that wasn't computing anything (and
    returning an error).


Changes in version 4.3.2

  o Fixed bug in xpose.VPC when asking for logx=T (didn't work
    previously).

  o Fixed dOFV.vs.id for when there are ties in individual dOFV drops.

Changes in version 4.3.0
  o Updated read.nm.tables so that comma separated NONMEM 7 files
    can be read into Xpose.

  o Changing the behaviour of xpose.multiple.plot.default. Now
    multiple plots are returned as objects just like single plots are
    (no automatic printing from the function that created the plot
    list). This is accomplished by defining a new class -
    xpose.multiple.plots - and corresponding print and show methods for
    that class. 

  o Updated xpose.VPC, xpose.VPC.categorical and xpose.VPC.both to
    handle the new format of PsN vpc_results.csv
    files. 

  o xpose.VPC.categorical now has a new option: censored (T or F)
    which will create BLOQ VPC plots when TRUE.  

  o xpose.VPC.both tries to combine continuous and categorical BLOQ
    plots.

  o page numbers can be turned off in multiple page plots using the
    page.numbers option (T or F).

Changes in version 4.1.0
  o Updated ind.plots(), the function is much more flexible now.
  o Added graphical options to xpose.VPC.categorical()
  o Fixed logy=T option for xpose.VPC(Pi.ci=T,logy=T).
  o Fixed logy=T and logx=T option (bug resulting in error).
  o VPC changed to require that y-axis be continuous as default.
  o Fixed classic version of parm.vs.parm() plot.
  o Fixed runsum(). Previous version had a line between each line in
    model file.
  o Added a new function change.xvardef(), which replaces much of the
    previous change functions. Thanks to Sébastien Bihorel for 
    input which helped create this function.
  o Added the ability to apply functions to the xaxis of plots. The
    function options are now called funx and funy.
  o Added support for reading NONMEM 7 table and output files. 
  o Added functions for odd type (categorical, TTE, count) plots including
    VPCs.
  o Updated handling of PsN vpc output file
  o Updated interpretation of categories in xpose.VPC.categorical()

Changes in version 4.0.4 
  o cwres.vs.pred.bw() was fixed. Previously cwres.vs.pred.bw() gave the
    same result as cwres.vs.idv.bw(). 
  o Fixed xpose.VPC() bug causing plots to not be created in some
    situations.  
  o Added functionality to xpose.VPC() so that users can define their
    own titles for each subplot if stratification is used in the VPC.
    see ?xpose.VPC for more info.
  o Updated method for opening graphical devices in windows to be
    consistent with the new methods used in R version 2.8.0. 
  o Added functionality to allow the user to plot vertical and
    horizontal lines in histograms.  See ?xpose.panel.histogram for more
    information. 
  o Fixed small bug with xpose.panel.splom(). 

Changes in version 4.0.3
  o in compute.cwres() a debugging flag had been left in the file
    resulting in R going into debugging mode when this function was
    called. This has been fixed. 

Changes in version 4.0.2
  o Added ability to smooth the PI.ci "area" plots so that they match
    the "line" plots.  See 'PI.ci.area.smooth' in
    xpose.pandel.default()
  o Added 'logx' and 'logy' functionality to the PI plots.
  o Changed the par.summary and cov.summary routines and removed
    functions doing almost the same thing (adding that functionality
    to the current functions). 
  o fixed GAM plot problems in xp.plot() and added more support for
    GAM from the command line.
  o Fixed a problem with ind.plots() when the ID variable is not
    called ID.
  o Changed all functions in xpose4specific that began with "abs." to
    begin with "absval." to be consistant with the rules for generic
    function definitions in R.
  o Changed name of add.abs() to add.absval().
  o Changed name of par.summary() to parm.summary().   
  o Changed name of param.vs.cov() to parm.vs.cov().
  o Changed name of param.vs.param() to parm.vs.parm().
